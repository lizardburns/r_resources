```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
path <- "C:/Users/stephen.price/OneDrive - Ofqual/my_home/tools/task_scheduler/"
```

# Create a project directory for scripts
1. Right click on the "Task scheduler library" in the left-hand panel
2. Select "New folder..." and create a directory

```{r}
include_graphics(file.path(path, "create_dir.PNG"))
```

# Click Create task...
1. **General** tab: enter a name and description for task
2. **Triggers** tab: Click "New...", select "Daily" and then enter a date and time, then set an "Expire" date (usually two weeks for consultations)
3. **Actions** tab: 
  - click "New...",
  - You want the default action, "Start a program", which will invoke R from the command prompt
  - paste the path to your Rscript.exe into the Program/script box. This will be something like:
    + `"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.2\bin\Rscript.exe"` - **you need the inverted commas if there are spaces in your path!!**
  - paste the command you need R to run into the "Add arguments" box:
    + `-e "source('O:/DIVISIONAL DRIVES/Standards and Research/Data analytics/Data innovations/Visualisations/Interactive/Consultations/vtq_2021_part2/vtq2021_part2_taskmaster.R')"`
    + again, the inverted commas are needed

```{r}
include_graphics(file.path(path, "create_action.PNG"))
```

4. **Conditions** tab: uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power"
5. **Settings** tab: set up as in screenshot (that's **5** minutes!)

```{r}
include_graphics(file.path(path, "settings.PNG"))
```

You should be good to go!
